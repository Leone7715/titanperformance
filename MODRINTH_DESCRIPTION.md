# Titan Performance

## The Ultimate All-in-One Minecraft Performance Mod

Titan Performance is a comprehensive Fabric optimization mod that dramatically boosts your FPS by combining 8 powerful optimization modules into one seamless package. Stop installing dozens of separate mods and get everything you need in one click.

Developed by LeoneDev at LeonesModFactory

## Why Choose Titan Performance?

Titan Performance offers significant advantages over the traditional approach of installing multiple mods:

One mod to install instead of 6 to 8 separate mods.
Auto-configures for your hardware instead of manual tweaking.
One settings screen instead of multiple config files.
Zero conflicts between modules.
Iris shader compatible.

## Performance Boost You Can Feel

### Real FPS Improvements

Low-End PC: 50 to 100 percent FPS boost.
Mid-Range PC: 30 to 60 percent FPS boost.
High-End PC: 15 to 40 percent FPS boost.

### What Gets Optimized?

Chunk Rendering with smarter chunk updates and no more stuttering.
Entity Culling that skips rendering what you cannot see.
Entity Throttling so distant mobs use less CPU.
Lighting Engine with batched light updates for smooth gameplay.
Memory Management with less garbage collection and fewer lag spikes.
Particle System that reduces particle lag in busy areas.
Frame Pacing for smoother frame times and fewer stutters.
Dynamic FPS that saves power when alt-tabbed or in menus.

## 8 Optimization Modules

### Rendering Optimizer
Intelligent chunk rendering with frustum culling and update scheduling. Prevents frame drops during chunk loading.

### Entity Culler
Skip rendering entities outside your view. Uses distance and visibility checks to save GPU power.

### Entity Throttler
Reduce tick frequency for distant and idle entities. Mobs far away do not need full processing.

### Lighting Optimizer
Batch and defer light calculations to prevent stuttering when many lights change.

### Memory Optimizer
Object pooling and allocation reduction. Minimizes garbage collection pauses.

### Particle Optimizer
Cull distant particles and reduce particle count when FPS is low.

### Smooth FPS
Detects and reduces frame time spikes. Proactive garbage collection during safe moments.

### Dynamic FPS
Automatically limits FPS when the window is unfocused to save power, when the game is minimized for near-paused state, and when in menus since high FPS is not needed.

## Iris Shader Compatibility

Yes, Titan Performance works with Iris Shaders.

When Iris and Sodium are detected:
Rendering modules auto-disable since Sodium handles those.
All other optimizations stay active.
You get shaders and performance boosts together.

## Easy Configuration

### In-Game Settings
Access settings via the Options menu with the Titan Perf button (top-left), Video Settings with the Titan Perf button, or press P to open settings anytime.

### Keybinds (Customizable)
P opens Titan Settings.
F8 toggles Dynamic FPS.

### Auto-Configuration
Titan Performance detects your hardware and auto-configures optimal settings including CPU cores and threading capability, available memory, and hardware tier (Low/Medium/High/Ultra). No manual tweaking needed.
